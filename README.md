# Temperature-Analysis
Inspired by a visualization portrayed in "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by E. Tufte, I decided to make an analysis of temperature for the city of Mississauga, ON and hopefully get some insights related to global warming

## Collect Data
For this project I collected the data from NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information) API.  https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation
